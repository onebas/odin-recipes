        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. </li>
            <li> Combine eggs, onion, celery, bell pepper, and relish in a large bowl. Stir together salad dressing, sugar, mustard, vinegar, celery seed, and salt in a small bowl. Pour over eggs and vegetables. Top with cooled macaroni; stir until well combined. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving. </li>
